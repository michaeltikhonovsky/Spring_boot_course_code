# Spring Boot Course Project

## Introduction
This program is based of a course on YouTube by AmigosCode. It is an intro to using Spring Boot as well as working with databases. It interacts with a database to store student's information such as ID number, Name, DOB, Email, and Age. It also includes a custom API with requests to add students, remove students, and to change students names or emails.

## How to Run
Open the project in your IDE and run the DemoApplication.java file. A page will be created on http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student
The LocalHost page is where you can view the changes from the api requests.

## Disclaimer
I do not own this code. I simply followed a YouTube tutorial and edited certain parts of the code. I followed the course for personal practice and wanted to upload it to my GitHub.
